   The history of the palace is tied to that of the Mewar kingdom, which had reached its heights near the territory of Nagda. The kingdom's founder was Guhil, who established the Maharana dominance in the year 568 AD. Subsequently, his successor Maharana Uday Singh II inherited the Mewar kingdom at Chittor in 1537, but the threat of losing control of the kingdom to the Mughals compelled him to move the capital to a region near Lake Pichola. Flanked by forests, lakes and the mighty Aravalli Hills, the new city of Udaipur was safe from invaders and went on to build the palace on the advice of a hermit.
   City Palace, Udaipur, is a palace complex situated in the city of Udaipur, Rajasthan. It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty.
